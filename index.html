            Vampire Legion was created back in the boondocks of time, a few short months after the games release.
            The original creator being UKxTrauma, he has since passed the torch to other origianl core members in turn.
            Currently Jedishane is the guild lead and is frequently in the guild chat.
            <br><br>
            The guild itself started as a noob-friendly farming guild, nowadays it's a safe haven for casual players
            and we still value newcomers to the game, to help and nuture their growing skills.
            <br><br>
            Member log-in will be utilised in a future update, with the effect of the names within the members page becoming links to their profiles and personalised records.
